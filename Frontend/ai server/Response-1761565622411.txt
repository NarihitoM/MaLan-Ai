Sure, I can help you clean up and improve the content of your `README.md` file. 
Here's a revised version:

```markdown
# Ai Development

This is the development repository for our MaLan-Ai Project.

## Made By
- Narihito
- Riae
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Removed unnecessary line breaks**: The `README.md` file should be clean and 
easy to read.
2. **Added a section header**: "Made By" is now a section header for better 
organization.
3. **Formatted names**: Listed the names under the "Made By" section for 
clarity.

If you need any additional information or sections (like installation 
instructions, usage examples, etc.), feel free to let me know!
