javascript
Your `package.json` file looks well-structured and includes a variety of 
dependencies and scripts for a modern web application. Here are a few 
observations and suggestions:

### Observations:
1. **Project Type**: The `"type": "module"` indicates that you are using ES 
modules, which is a good practice for modern JavaScript projects.
2. **Scripts**: You have defined scripts for development (`dev`), building 
(`build`), linting (`lint`), and previewing (`preview`).
3. **Dependencies**: You have a mix of frontend and backend dependencies, 
including React, Express, and Azure SDKs.
4. **DevDependencies**: You are using ESLint for linting and Vite for bundling 
and development server.
5. **Overrides**: You have overridden the `vite` dependency to use 
`rolldown-vite`.

### Suggestions:
1. **Versioning**: Consider setting a more meaningful version number for your 
project instead of `"0.0.0"`. This can help with version control and deployment.
2. **Security**: Ensure that all dependencies are up-to-date and secure. You can 
use tools like `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities.
3. **Documentation**: Add comments or documentation to explain the purpose of 
each script and dependency. This can be helpful for other developers or for 
future reference.
4. **Environment Variables**: Since you are using `dotenv`, make sure to create 
a `.env` file to manage environment-specific variables securely.
5. **TypeScript**: If you are using TypeScript, consider adding 
TypeScript-related dependencies and configuration.
6. **Linting Configuration**: Ensure that your ESLint configuration is set up 
correctly. You might want to create an `.eslintrc.json` file if you haven't 
already.

### Example `.eslintrc.json`:
```json
{
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "es2021": true,
    "node": true
  },
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:react/recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended"
  ],
  "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaFeatures": {
      "jsx": true
    },
    "ecmaVersion": 12,
    "sourceType": "module"
  },
  "plugins": [
    "react",
    "@typescript-eslint"
  ],
  "rules": {
